Please select "**Satellite Workshop: Workshop on Mapping Brain-Body-Behavior Signal Dynamics in Human Speech Production and Interaction (WMB&SPI)**" on the drop down list during submission. 

Submitted workshop papers should abide by the ICASSP-2025 paper style, format, and length (Total 5 pages: 4 pages of main content + 1 page for References). More details on formatting and the author kit are available here: [https://2025.ieeeicassp.org/author-kit-instructions/](https://2025.ieeeicassp.org/author-kit-instructions/). We accept submissions that are novel contributions that haven't yet been published in a conference with proceedings or a journal. Submissions that do not adhere to these instructions will be desk-rejected.

All submissions go through a single-blind peer-review similar to ICASSP 2025 abiding by the main conference reviewing guidelines. Upon acceptance, paper authors will have the opportunity to present their paper at the workshop and there must be an author of each accepted workshop paper presenting it in-person. The workshop papers will be published on the IEEE Xplore Digital Library (with a separate conference record number).
