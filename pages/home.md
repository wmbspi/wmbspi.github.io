## **<span style="color:$gray-800">Mapping Brain-Body-Behavior Signal Dynamics in Human Speech Production and Interaction (MBBSD-HSPI)</span>**

Welcome to the website of the Workshop on Mapping Brain-Body-Behavior Signal Dynamics in Human Speech Production and Interaction (WMB&SPI), a Satellite Workshop of the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025). The workshop will be held in conjunction with ICASSP 2025, which will take place in Hyderabad, India from April 06 to April 11, 2025. The workshop is planned to be co-located with ICASSP 2025 and held adjacent to the dates of the conference (exact date of the workshop will be announced soon).

Advances in sensing, imaging, signal processing and machine learning allow mapping human brain-behaviour connections in real-world settings that were not imaginable even a few years ago, especially inspired by applications of societal relevance in health, education and work performance. Speech provides a rich platform to investigate and illuminate critical neuro, cognitive, and behavioural links, given its centrality in communication, but it is not yet fully understood. Critically, the details abouThe rich and pervasive variability in speech within and across individuals and for varied interactional contexts and the intricate flexibility in speech production are woefully incomplete. Furthermore, challenges to any of these systems dueto illness, injury or disorder are reflected in the production and processing of speech. Causal connections between speech signal variables and clinical evaluations, although not fully understood, do hold great promise as valuable and easily accessible biomarkers. Progress in multimodal signal acquisition and processing (e.g., EEG, real-time MRI, and a variety of physiological signals alongside audio and video), together with interdisciplinary approaches combining theory, experimentation and computational modelling, could enable design of appropriate and subjective brain-computer interfaces. 

The workshop will provide a unique opportunity for gathering an interdisciplinary deep scientific understanding of “brain behaviour basis of speech.” The workshop will be supported under the Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC) initiative supported by the Government of India (Hema Murthy, PI; Rajeswari Aghoram, Umesh S, Mriganka Sur, and Shri Narayanan are Co-PIs).
